## What This Thread Was Doing

Northstar g03.012 audited the adopted portfolio for duplicate lifecycle currentness. This repository has exact mechanical findings and needs one repository-local repair lane.

## Why It Matters

Canonical lifecycle JSON and generated projections can disagree with hand-maintained status or frontier prose. That creates a second mechanical authority and keeps agents doing manual closeout bookkeeping.

## Current State

- Canonical task: [`g01.015`](../roadmaps/g01/015-repair-lifecycle-currentness.md).
- Planning base before this handoff: `b3abb46245382e194ce52dd6ae0f11d7619a168b`.
- The integration checkout was clean and synchronized before promotion.
- Exact currentness findings:
- `docs/README.md` — `stale-frontier` in `Next Task` for `g01.014`
- `docs/roadmaps/README.md` — `stale-frontier` in `Next Task` for `g01.014`
- `docs/roadmaps/g01/README.md` — `stale-frontier` in `Next Task` for `g01.014`
- No terminal-task handoff backlink was found in the bounded inventory.

## Boundaries

Edit documentation and planning surfaces only. Apply the task's exact accepted removals and task-free frontier replacements. Do not edit product code, releases, Queue/Effigy source, unrelated planning, generation disposition, or Paseo threads/workspaces.

## Important Context

Use the currently installed Northstar skill. Re-run the audit before editing. Generated lifecycle blocks and this submitted handoff are hook-owned at closeout. Preserve semantic goals, history, policy, decisions, dependencies, and continuation. A doubtful line stays untouched and is returned to Chatterbox with exact path and lines.

## Suggested Next Move

Start from the audit output and repair one listed finding at a time. Never delete a handoff manually.

## Completion Protocol

Open one non-draft PR from the Queue workspace. Run `effigy skill run northstar/lifecycle:run -- audit-currentness --repo .`, lifecycle projection verification, repository docs checks, normal QA, and `git diff --check`. Independent review must confirm exact-head scope and zero remaining violations. After merge, let the configured repository hook publish terminal state, refresh generated projections, and consume this submitted handoff. Send no routine progress notification; escalate only semantic ambiguity or a decision-changing blocker.
