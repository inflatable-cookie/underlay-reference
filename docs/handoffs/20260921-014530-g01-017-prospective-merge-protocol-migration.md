## What This Thread Was Doing

Apply Northstar g03.020's accepted Queue manifest migration to Underlay Reference.

## Why It Matters

The prospective merge target checks the tree Queue will actually merge. A newer
base change outside the lane no longer produces a false reviewed-head refusal,
so Underlay Reference's lanes stop stalling on stale-branch comparisons.

## Current State

Underlay Reference main is clean and synchronized at the planning commit containing this
handoff. The installed migration dry-run accepts the exact v3 manifest. Required
sibling worktree links: none. Use the automatic mechanical/general pool;
frontier-worker justification: none.

## Boundaries

Change only `.paseo/queue.json` through the installed command. Do not change
product code or planning, dependencies, releases, CI, Queue state, threads or
workspaces.

## Important Context

Run `effigy skill run northstar/lifecycle:migrate-premerge` first, then the same
selector with `-- --write`. The only accepted edit is v3 to v4 plus
`reviewed_head` to `prospective_merge`. Divergent manifests fail closed; do not
hand-edit around a refusal.

## Suggested Next Move

Verify the clean branch and the committed handoff, run dry-run and write mode,
then inspect the complete diff before validation.

## Completion Protocol

Prove `applied`, then `unchanged` on replay, validate the v4 manifest, run the
focused repository checks and `git diff --check`. Commit and push one non-draft
PR and report `ready_for_review` through the authenticated Queue callback.
Independent review uses another provider/model identity. Do not merge, refresh
an installed skill, mutate other repositories or publish a release.
